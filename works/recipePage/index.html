            <p id="parag1">This Filipino icebox dessert consists of layers of graham crackers, sweetened whipped cream, and ripe mango. Be sure to chill everything, especially the cream, condensed milk, glass dish, mixing bowl, and beaters for the mixer. This will help the cream whip more quickly and everything come together well during assembly. Thaw the float before serving, or serve slightly frozen. Enjoy with your favorite dessert wine, cocktail, coffee or tea! Filipino mango float is a no bake dessert. The mango float is super easy to make but waiting to eat is agony! You will need to refrigerate the dessert overnight to ensure that the cream settles and the crackers become soft.This dessert is perfect for ripe fresh mangoes. – the perfect dessert for hot summer days.</p>

                <h2>Freezing Instruction (optional)</h2>
                <p>Instead of refrigerating the mango float, you can also freeze it overnight! When you freeze it overnight, you will end up with an ice cream-like texture. Before serving, let the mango sit out for 30 minutes or until desired softness. This will make it easier for you to cut it as well. I prefer this option when I want to have a delicious ice cream cake</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>Peel the mangoes and cut the lobes off as close to the pit as possible. Thinly slice half of the mango lobes into ¹⁄₁₆-inch (15 mm)-thick slices, keeping the slices intact and transferring to a tray or plate. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble. Cut the remaining mango into ½-inch (1.24 cm) cubes. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to assemble.</p>
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>Add 2 cups of cream to a chilled large bowl and use an electric hand mixer to beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 3–5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 cups of cream and beat again until stiff peaks form, 3–5 minutes more.</p>
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
                <p>Add half of the condensed milk and beat until fully incorporated. Add the remaining condensed milk, vanilla, and salt and beat until fully incorporated and stiff peaks form, 4–7 minutes. Give the mixture a final stir with a rubber spatula.</p>
            <h5>Step 5</h5>
                <p>Line a chilled 7 x 11 (17 x 27 cm) -inch glass dish with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides.</p>
            <h5>Step 6</h5>
                <p>Cover the bottom of the dish with a single layer of graham crackers, breaking to fill in any gaps as necessary. Spread 2–3 cups (480-720 ml) of the whipped cream mixture evenly over the graham crackers, all the way to the edges and corners of the dish. Top with ½ of the diced mango. Repeat to make another layer. For the final layer, arrange the graham crackers over the diced mango and top with 2–3 cups of whipped cream. Arrange the thinly sliced mango decoratively on top. Sprinkle crushed graham crackers around the edge of the float.</p>
            <h5>Step 7</h5>
                <p>Cover the mango float in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4–6 hours, until the cream sets and the graham crackers soften and absorb some moisture. Transfer the float to the freezer for 8 hours, or overnight.</p>
            <h5>Step 7</h5>
                <p>Remove the float from the freezer and use the parchment paper to lift out of the dish. Let thaw for 5–10 minutes before slicing.</p>
            <h5>Step 8</h5>
                <p>Serve with your favorite dessert wine, cocktail, coffee, or tea.</p>
            <h5>Step 9</h5>
                <p>Enjoy!</p>
