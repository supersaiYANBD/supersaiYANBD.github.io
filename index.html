            <p>My name is Yan Blaire Dologuin, and I hail from the beautiful archipelago of the Philippines. For almost 21 years, I called the Philippines home, immersing myself in its rich culture and diverse landscapes. However, my life took an exciting turn in March 2023 when I made the transcontinental leap and settled in the United States. As I embark on this new chapter, I eagerly embrace the opportunities and adventures that await me in my new American journey. With a blend of my Filipino heritage and newfound experiences, I am excited to contribute positively to this multicultural society and foster new connections along the way. </p>
            <p>I am a college student who recently enrolled and embarked on an exciting educational journey. With my passion for web development, I utilized the knowledge gained from my lessons to create several websites. These past few weeks have been filled with exploration, curiosity, and the joy of putting my skills into practice. I am thrilled to be on this path of self-discovery, honing my abilities, and embracing the opportunities that lie ahead in my college experience.</p>
